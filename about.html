            The Maqdala Manuscripts are Ethiopian Christian Orthodox texts from
            the 14th to 19th century. They include many things like religeous
            treatises books. Because they are some of the greatest pieces of
            Ethiopian artwork ever made, they have important cultural
            significance for the people of Ethiopia.

            They are called the Maqdala manuscripts because in the 19th century,
            Emperor Tweodros II wanted to unify Ethiopia. One thing he did was
            scour the country for the greatest Ethiopian writings. He then
            gathered them into a single book at his mountain fort in Maqdala
            (modern day Amba Mariam).

            In 1868, the British, led by Robert Napier, invaded Ethiopia with
            13,000 troops. They did this in response to the Emperor holding some
            British hostage in retaliation for ignoring his pleas to develop
            relations with the British. The Battle of Maqdala caused the Emperor
            to commit suicide and caused the manuscripts to be taken by Brits as
            spoils of war.

            Currently, the Ethiopian Government and the British Government are
            having talks to return these historic manuscripts back to their
            country of origin. While long-term loans have been agreed to thus
            far, it seems very unlikely that the permanent relocation of these
            artifacts takes place.
